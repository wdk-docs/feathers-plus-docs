mongoose-advanced guide
=====================================

This mongoose adapter has the same interface as the feathers-ecosystem
mongooose adapter. The main difference between the two is how bulk
creates are handled.

Bulk Creates
------------

When doing bulk creates this adapter will add any validation/write
errors onto the params object and will not throw an error. This is to
allow the errors and successful inserts to be handled within an after
hook.

.. code:: js

   // Schema == { name: { type: String, required: true } }
   const data = [
     { name: 'dave' },
     { foo: 'bar' },
     { name: 'bob' },
     { jane: 'doe' }
   ]

This would result in the response from the create method to have the two
data objects with the name property and the other two which would have
failed on validation errors would be placed on the hook under the
following path by default: ``hook.params.errors``.

The create method checks for an array of items and will utilize this
built in ``_insertMany`` method of mongoose, this is opposed to using
the default ``create`` method which will call a ``.save`` on each array
item.

Errors
------

When accessing the errors on the params object they should have an
``error.type`` of either ``ValidionError`` or ``WriteError`` depending
on which failed.

Access the errors:

.. code:: js

   app.service('todos').hooks({
     after: {
       create: [
         context => {
           if (context.params.errors && context.params.errors.length) {
             context.params.errors.forEach(item => {
               // This will show the type of error and the data that failed
               console.log(item.error.type, item.data)
             })
           }
         }
       ]
     }
   })

The data which failed should be available on the error object.
