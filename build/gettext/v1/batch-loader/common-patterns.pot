msgid "In many applications, a server using batch-loader serves requests to many different users with different access permissions. It may be dangerous to use one cache across many users, and it is encouraged to create a new batch-loader per request:"

#: ../../source/v1/batch-loader/common-patterns.rst:32
msgid "Occasionally, some kind of value can be accessed in multiple ways. For example, perhaps a “User” type can be loaded not only by an “id” but also by a “username” value. If the same user is loaded by both keys, then it may be useful to fill both caches when a user is loaded from either source:"

msgid "Persistent caches"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/v1/batch-loader/common-patterns.rst:57
msgid "By default, batch-loader uses the standard Map which simply grows until the batch-loader is released. A custom cache is provided as a convenience if you want to persist caches for longer periods of time. It implements a **least-recently-used** algorithm and allows you to limit the number of records cached."

msgid "batch-loader provides a simplified and consistent API over various data sources, when its used as part of your application’s data fetching layer. Custom Feathers services can use batch-loaders to natively accesses local and remote resources."

#: ../../source/v1/batch-loader/common-patterns.rst:118
msgid "While not a key-value store, SQL offers a natural batch mechanism with SELECT \\* WHERE IN statements. While batch-loader is best suited for key-value stores, it is still suited for SQL when queries remain simple. This example requests the entire row at a given id, however your usage may differ."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/v1/batch-loader/common-patterns.rst:124
msgid "This example uses the sqlite3 client which offers a parallelize method to further batch queries together. Another non-caching batch-loader utilizes this method to provide a similar API. batch-loaders can access other batch-loaders."
